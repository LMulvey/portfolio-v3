Starting off 2020 with a refresh of my personal site. Overall, the design is mostly the same. I'm not a designer by any stretch of the imagination but the site is, hopefully, a good representation of my work and my personality.

### The Stack

This is a development blog after all, so let's talk stack. I had used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) on a bunch of side projects and my old portfolio used the original version of Gatsby. I wanted to upgrade to the latest and greatest. My old blog also existed on a separate repo and was an old Jekyll setup, which I wasn't a huge fan of. Customizing it was a bit of a pain and I didn't like managing two separate ecosystems.

So, I wanted to shift everything onto Gatsby and maintain the easy authoring experience for me as writing my posts in Markdown can be done ANYWHEREâ€“especially with GitHub's UI. I started off with a fantastic starter project by Robin Wieruch - [gatsby-mdx-blog-starter](https://github.com/rwieruch/gatsby-mdx-blog-starter-project). From there, I ported over everything from my old siteâ€“including a few custom `gatsby-node-plugin` scripts to push Projects to their own custom page templates.

Apart from a few bumps in the road with merging two conflicting `createNode` and `createPage` scripts, everything went fairly smoothly. Now, everything is running on the **_latest and greatest_**.

### What Next?

As I say every year, I wanted to make this easier to manage with the goal of publishing content more often. Let's hope I stick to my goal this year.
