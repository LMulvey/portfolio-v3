Writing clean, readable code is an everlasting journey that unforutantely forces you to _experience_ poorly written code and devise ways to overcome it. You can read all the books you want about
the subject (I recommend [Clean Code by Robert Martin](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), FYI) but you'll develop the best practices through, uh,
practice!

When writing complex control flow, sometimes your conditionals can get absolutely out of whack with a ton of conditions to be met. Take this code for example:

```js
function handleServerErrors(error) {
    // we need to determine that it is indeed a server error,
  // a specific response code, and we're not already on the
  // error page
  if ([500, 401, 501].includes(error.code)
      && error.errorType === 'A04F'
      && !router.pathname.includes('error-page')) {
    // handle our error here
    ...
  }
}
```

While that code is _mostly_ easy to read (and probably a poor example), our conditional is 120 columns in length and could take a future developer a bit longer than we'd want to try and
figure out exactly what that guard is doing. An easy fix is to break each condition into it's own variableâ€“this breaks each part of the condition out and makes it easy to test/change in the future if
needed. There's something to be said about performance here as initializing a bunch of variables will take up memory, but honestly, in most cases the benefits would outweight the performance cost:

```js
function handleServerErrors(error) {
  // we need to determine that it is indeed a server error,
  // a specific response code, and we're not already on the
  // error page
  const isSeriousCode = [404, 401, 501].includes(error.code);
  const isServerError = error.errorType === 'A04F';
  const isOnErrorPage = !router.pathname.includes('error-page');

  if (isSeriousCode && isServerError && !isOnErrorPage) {
    // handle our error here
    ...
  }
}
```

Yes, we have a few more lines of code here but it's much easier to reason about. You can read the conditions as a sentence: if it's a serious status code, and a server error, and we're not already on the error page, do the thing!

Try these in your next project if you see your conditionals reaching ridiculous lengthsâ€“it can help clean up the readability of your code and save you time when working through issues.
