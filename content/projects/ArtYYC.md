Started at the 2018 CivicTech YYC Hackathon, ArtYYC is an Android/iOS app developed in React Native geared towards enhancing the art discovery experience in Calgary, Alberta. Using predefined and collected datasets, we render art locations and information to an interactive mobile map that allows for easy discovery of local, undocumented, corporate and urban guerilla art. In addition, after launch of the alpha, the app will encourage crowd-sourcing information about unknown art in the city.

The app became funded underneath an arts grant in early 2019 and was handed off to the Beakerhead organization for further development.
