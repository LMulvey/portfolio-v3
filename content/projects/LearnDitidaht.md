Harnessed the familiarity of the Wordpress platform with the Reactive, fast and declarative nature of React to create a new gamified platform for learning Ditidahtâ€“an Indigenous language that has only six fluent speakers today-all of whom are in their 70's and 80's. We used React to create interactive and memorable exercises that help students learn and apply concepts of the language in a fun way. The work for this project is ongoing.
